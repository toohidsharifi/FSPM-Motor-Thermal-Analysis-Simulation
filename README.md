# Thermal Analysis Simulations of a Novel E-Core FSPM Motor
This repository contains the supplementary materials and numerical simulation files for the research paper: "Heat transfer investigations on a thermally superior alternative for the flux switching permanent magnet electric motor".

# Repository Language: English

The study presents a new design for a flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) motor that significantly enhances thermal performance by relocating the armature windings. This change reduces total power losses from 56.6 W to 39.6 W and mitigates the maximum operating temperature of the windings and permanent magnets (PMs) by 36.4% and 40%, respectively.

üìä Key Thermal Analysis Results
The following figures from the numerical study demonstrate the significant thermal improvements of the proposed motor design. The primary advantage comes from modifying the heat transfer paths. By relocating the armature windings (the main heat source) away from the heat-sensitive permanent magnets (PMs), the proposed design allows heat to dissipate more effectively through the stator core and motor casing, leading to a cooler and more efficient motor.

Conventional E-Core FSPM Motor (Baseline)
In the conventional design, the armature windings are placed adjacent to the PMs. This proximity creates a direct path for heat to flow from the windings into the magnets, resulting in a significant temperature increase in the PMs, which can degrade their magnetic properties and the motor's performance.

Proposed Thermally Superior FSPM Motor
The proposed motor relocates the windings around the middle tooth of the E-core stator. This key change isolates the PMs from the primary heat source. As a result, the generated heat from the windings is channeled through the stator core to the motor's outer casing, a much more efficient path for dissipation. This leads to a dramatic reduction in the operating temperature of both the windings and, most critically, the permanent magnets.
